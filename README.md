### App Evaluation

- **Category:** health 
- **Mobile:** This app will be primarily developed for mobile 
- **story:** The app helps users to scan the label of the food they are buying
so they know if the food has too many chemicals and the problems these ingredients
can cause in the health in the short/long time. Like for example if the food 
is canceginours or has too many sugar.
- **Habit:** This can use as often as the user wants or feel the need to help
understand how unhealthy or healthy the food they are buying is. 
- **Scoope:** The idea is to be a free app that helps its users to understand 
better what is inside the food they are buying which helps to eat healthier and 
avoid health problems in the long run.
